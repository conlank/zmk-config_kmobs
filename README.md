# Ferris Sweep ZMK Configuration

This repository contains a customized [ZMK](https://github.com/zmkfirmware/zmk) configuration for the split [Ferris Sweep](https://github.com/davidphilipbarr/Sweep) keyboard. It supports a pair of nice!nano v2 peripherals that communicate with a dedicated [Seeed Studio XIAO nRF52840](https://amzn.to/3LOPtYW) board acting as the split dongle. The key split transport is provided by the [ZMK ESB Split Transport module](https://github.com/badjeff/zmk-feature-split-esb) for low-latency communication between the halves and the dongle.

## Highlights

- Ferris Sweep layout with mirrored peripherals and shared keymap.
- ESB-based wireless split transport for reduced latency and reliable peripheral links.
- Dedicated XIAO BLE dongle build target for USB host connectivity.
- Battery reporting retained on peripherals with ESB transport.
- Improved battery benefits of being in Dongle mode. 
- GitHub Actions matrix configured to compile dongle and peripheral firmware artifacts.

## Repository Layout

- `boards/shields/sweep/` – Shield overlays, keymap, and Kconfig fragments for central and peripheral builds.
- `config/west.yml` – West manifest that pulls ZMK, the ESB module, and required Nordic SDK components.
- `build.yaml` – GitHub Actions matrix defining build outputs for the dongle and both peripherals.

## ESB Split Transport Notes

- Shared ESB addressing is defined in `boards/shields/sweep/sweep_esb_addr.dtsi`. Change these values if you manage multiple keyboard sets to avoid radio collisions.
- Peripheral IDs (`CONFIG_ZMK_SPLIT_ESB_PERIPHERAL_ID`) are unique per half to distinguish event sources.
- The central build disables BLE advertising to prioritize ESB traffic. Adjust the related options in the `.conf` files if you need BLE connectivity simultaneously.
